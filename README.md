This is just a demonstration of what
[sleigh-rs](https://github.com/rbran/sleigh-rs) and
[sleigh2rust](https://github.com/rbran/sleigh2rust) are able to accomplish.

The code in each folder was generated by parsing the sleigh files from
[ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) using
[sleigh-rs](https://github.com/rbran/sleigh-rs), then generating the rust code
with [sleigh2rust](https://github.com/rbran/sleigh2rust).

This project still in a early PoC (Proof-of-Concept) stage.
